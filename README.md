# Cascadia Code + Nerd Fonts 
Can we add Nerd Fonts to the [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) font using a GitHub Action?

Inspired by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/PatchingTheNewCascadiaCodeToIncludePowerlineGlyphsAndOtherNerdFontsForTheWindowsTerminal.aspx) and [Alistair Young](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/issues/10?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha#issuecomment-532969414).

The answer, it turns out, is yes.

### How to use
You can download the patched font from the [Releases page](https://github.com/adam7/delugia-code/releases) of this repo and install them as you would any other font.
